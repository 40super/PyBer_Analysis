# Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a summary on data in the three types of cities which are urban, suburban, and rural.

## Results

### Summary of rides

When looking at the data there are some differences that can be seen right away. One difference is that although rural areas have the least amount of drivers, they have the highest average fare. Furthermore, this can be because in rural areas, travelling requires to move long distances to get to a destination while urban areas you do not need to travel far to reach common destinations. As a result, the higher fares are reasonable in rural areas. Suburban is the median between both rural and urban where it does not have any data where it is the highest or lowest. On the other hand, urban had the most drivers and had the most fares produced.

### Weekly Fare Graph

This graph show the total fare by city type on a weekly basis. When looking at the graph the urban city is performing the best while the rural type is performing not as good as both suburban and urban.

## Summary

In summary there are three recommendation that can help CEO to help with the disparity. Some recommendation would be provide incentive for rural city type so there will be more drivers available. This can help with average fare cost since there are more drivers available. Second recommendation would be adjusting the cost of rides based on city type which can help rural prices be lower and more accessible. Third recommendation would implement a reward system when using pyber to incentivise people to use it.
