When looking at the data there are some differences that can be seen right away. One difference is that although rural areas have the least amount of drivers, they have the highest average fare. Furthermore, this can be because in rural areas, travelling requires to move long distances to get to a destination while urban areas you do not need to travel far to reach common destinations. As a result, the higher fares are reasonable in rural areas. Suburban is the median between both rural and urban where it does not have any data where it is the highest or lowest. On the other hand, urban had the most drivers and had the most fares produced.
